# Matrix calculus

As part of an online course about autonomous driving cars, this code creates functions to do matrix calculus.
This Matrix calculus was used on matrices representing how the car sees it's envrionemets and obstacles through its sensors.

Functions created :
- determinant calculation
- trace calculation
- inverse calculation
- transpose calculation
- matrix multiplication and square
